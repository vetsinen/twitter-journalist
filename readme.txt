Hi,

My name is John and I am journalist. 
To get the latest news about specified persons (twitter users) I would need you to develop me a REST API that would get me the latest tweets from those persons. I would like to also set those persons by myself via an API method where I could either add or remove persons. You will store added persons on your side. 

Look at an example bahaviour of such API:
1) I add user XYZ via API method
2) I call a method that get me the latest tweets for added persons (only person XYZ in this case) via API method
3) I remove user XYZ via API method 

See the attached API documentation of such system.

Also see external documenations that could help you with this task:
developer.twitter.com/en/docs
php.net/docs.php

Once ready and tested please send me the source code of your API

Regards,
John the journalist
